    "Questions": "What is coronary artery disease?",
    "Answers": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a condition where the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked due to plaque buildup. This plaque consists of cholesterol, fatty deposits, and other substances that accumulate on the inner walls of arteries.",

    "Questions": "What are the main symptoms of a heart attack?",
    "Answers": "The main symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain or pressure, shortness of breath, pain radiating to the arm, neck, or jaw, cold sweats, nausea, and lightheadedness. Women may experience less typical symptoms like fatigue and back pain.",

  {
    "Questions": "How does high blood pressure affect the heart?",
    "Answers": "High blood pressure forces the heart to work harder to pump blood, which can lead to heart muscle thickening (hypertrophy), weakening of the heart muscle, and increased risk of heart failure. It also damages blood vessels and accelerates plaque buildup.",

  {
    "Questions": "What is heart failure?",
    "Answers": "Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle can't pump blood efficiently enough to meet the body's needs. It doesn't mean the heart has stopped but rather that it's not working as well as it should. This can result in fatigue, breathing problems, and fluid buildup.",

    "Questions": "What is an arrhythmia?",

  {
    "Questions": "What role does cholesterol play in heart disease?",
    "Answers": "Cholesterol, particularly LDL (bad) cholesterol, can build up in artery walls, forming plaque that narrows and hardens arteries (atherosclerosis). This restricts blood flow and increases heart attack risk. HDL (good) cholesterol helps remove LDL from arteries.",

  {
    "Questions": "What are heart valve disorders?",
    "Answers": "Heart valve disorders occur when heart valves don't work properly, either not opening fully (stenosis) or not closing properly (regurgitation). This can disrupt blood flow through the heart and affect its ability to pump efficiently.",

  {
    "Questions": "What is the difference between heart attack and cardiac arrest?",
    "Answers": "A heart attack occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is blocked, causing tissue damage. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating altogether. While a heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest, they are different conditions requiring different treatments.",

  {
    "Questions": "How does diabetes increase heart disease risk?",
    "Answers": "Diabetes increases heart disease risk by damaging blood vessels and nerves that control the heart. High blood sugar levels can cause inflammation and build-up of fatty deposits in blood vessels. Diabetics are also more likely to have high blood pressure and cholesterol.",

  {
    "Questions": "What is angina?",
    "Answers": "Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It often feels like pressure, squeezing, or burning in the chest and can also affect the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It's a common symptom of coronary artery disease.",

  {
    "Questions": "What is a stress test?",
    "Answers": "A stress test measures how your heart performs during physical activity. During the test, you exercise (usually on a treadmill) while doctors monitor your heart rhythm, blood pressure, and breathing. It helps diagnose coronary artery disease and evaluate treatment plans.",

    "Questions": "What is an echocardiogram?",

  {
    "Questions": "How does smoking affect heart health?",
    "Answers": "Smoking damages blood vessels, reduces oxygen in blood, and increases blood pressure and heart rate. It also promotes blood clot formation and plaque buildup in arteries. Smokers have a significantly higher risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke.",

  {
    "Questions": "How does obesity affect heart health?",
