How does high blood pressure affect the heart?,"""High blood pressure forces the heart to work harder to pump blood, which can lead to heart muscle thickening (hypertrophy), weakening of the heart muscle, and increased risk of heart failure. It also damages blood vessels and accelerates plaque buildup.""","""What damage does hypertension cause?|Effects of high blood pressure on heart|Impact of hypertension""",Hypertension|Risk Factors|Complications
What is heart failure?,"Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle can't pump blood efficiently enough to meet the body's needs.

This can result in fatigue, breathing problems, and fluid buildup.",Define heart failure|What happens in heart failure?|Explain heart failure condition,Heart Failure|Basic Concepts|Chronic Conditions
What lifestyle changes can prevent heart disease?,"Key lifestyle changes include maintaining a healthy diet low in saturated fats and salt, regular exercise (at least 150 minutes per week), maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol intake, and managing stress through relaxation techniques.",How to prevent heart disease?|Heart disease prevention tips|Ways to avoid heart problems,Prevention|Lifestyle|Health Management
What is an arrhythmia?,"An arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat where the heart beats too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or with an irregular pattern. It occurs when the electrical signals controlling heartbeat don't work properly.",What causes irregular heartbeat?|Define cardiac arrhythmia|Types of arrhythmia,Arrhythmia|Heart Rhythm|Basic Concepts
What role does cholesterol play in heart disease?,"Cholesterol, particularly LDL (bad) cholesterol, can build up in artery walls, forming plaque that narrows and hardens arteries (atherosclerosis). This restricts blood flow and increases heart attack risk. HDL (good) cholesterol helps remove LDL from arteries.",How does cholesterol affect the heart?|Cholesterol and heart disease connection|Impact of high cholesterol,Cholesterol|Risk Factors|Blood Tests
What are heart valve disorders?,"Heart valve disorders occur when heart valves don't work properly, either not opening fully (stenosis) or not closing properly (regurgitation). This can disrupt blood flow through the heart and affect its ability to pump efficiently.",Types of valve problems|What are valvular heart diseases?|Heart valve disease explanation,Valve Disease|Structural Heart Disease|Basic Concepts
What is the difference between heart attack and cardiac arrest?,"A heart attack occurs when blood flow to part of the heart is blocked, causing tissue damage. Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart suddenly stops beating altogether. While a heart attack can lead to cardiac arrest, they are different conditions requiring different treatments.",Heart attack vs cardiac arrest|Difference between cardiac events|Compare heart emergencies,Emergency|Heart Attack|Cardiac Arrest
How does diabetes increase heart disease risk?,Diabetes increases heart disease risk by damaging blood vessels and nerves that control the heart. High blood sugar levels can cause inflammation and build-up of fatty deposits in blood vessels. Diabetics are also more likely to have high blood pressure and cholesterol.,Diabetes heart disease connection|Why do diabetics have heart problems?|Diabetes cardiovascular risk,Diabetes|Risk Factors|Comorbidities
What is angina?,"Angina is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. It often feels like pressure, squeezing, or burning in the chest and can also affect the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back. It's a common symptom of coronary artery disease.",What causes chest pain?|Define angina pectoris|Types of angina,Angina|Symptoms|CAD
What is a stress test?,"A stress test measures how your heart performs during physical activity. During the test, you exercise (usually on a treadmill) while doctors monitor your heart rhythm, blood pressure, and breathing. It helps diagnose coronary artery disease and evaluate treatment plans.",How does a cardiac stress test work?|Purpose of stress testing|Heart exercise test explanation,Diagnosis|Tests|Medical Procedures
"""What causes heart disease in young adults?","Heart disease in young adults can be caused by congenital defects, genetics, obesity, smoking, drug use, diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol. Lifestyle factors like poor diet, lack of exercise, and stress also contribute significantly.",Young people heart problems|Early onset heart disease|Youth cardiovascular issues,Young Adults|Risk Factors|Prevention
What is an echocardiogram?,"An echocardiogram is an ultrasound test that uses sound waves to create detailed images of the heart's structure and function. It shows the size, shape, and movement of heart chambers, valves function, and blood flow patterns.",What is an echo test?|Heart ultrasound explanation|Purpose of echocardiography,Diagnosis|Tests|Medical Procedures
How does smoking affect heart health?,"Smoking damages blood vessels, reduces oxygen in blood, and increases blood pressure and heart rate. It also promotes blood clot formation and plaque buildup in arteries. Smokers have a significantly higher risk of heart disease, heart attacks, and stroke.",Smoking heart disease connection|Effects of tobacco on heart|Why is smoking bad for heart,Smoking|Risk Factors|Prevention
How does obesity affect heart health?,"Obesity increases heart disease risk by raising blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes risk. Excess weight makes the heart work harder, leading to strain on the heart muscle and increased inflammation throughout the body.",Why is weight linked to heart problems?|Impact of obesity on heart|Weight and cardiovascular risk,Obesity|Risk Factors|Prevention
What is meant by 'silent heart attack'?,"A silent heart attack occurs with minimal or no symptoms, often discovered later during routine tests.
